# LeNet-5 (MNIST) and Sharpness Aware Minimization
We performed a task on LeNet-5 in SSU deep learning programming and hands-on classes.  
The challenge topic was to think about how to improve the performance of LeNet-5.  
I thought generalization-ability was also an important indicator to evaluate the performance of the model.  
I've seen previous studies that the sharpness of loss landscape affects the performance of generalization,  
and I studied how to increase the performance of generalization by applying Sharpness Aware Minimization on LeNet-5.
